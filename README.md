The goal of Snorkle is to give users a platform where they can explore local attractions. The attractions are shown on a 3d map (MapBox). If the users are logged in (Google, LinkedIn, GitHub) they can also create attractions themselfs. Through drag/drop they add information (history, activities, general description, image) about it. A snorkle is created. It helps tourists to better dive into the attraction. When a user visits an attraction he/she can check-in. All the loggedin users see a realtime overview over the checked-in visitors of an attraction.
